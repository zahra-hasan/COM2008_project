# System design project
This is the HomeBreaks team project for COM2008 using Java and mySQL.
# Project objective
The project objective was to create a software system to meet the needs of an organisation called HomeBreaks Plc, which manages a collection of small properties for short-term lease by hosts to renting guests. The software system will capture details about the properties, their hosts and guests, and will manage bookings and reviews of the properties. The security aspect is that contact details for individuals and the precise locations of properties are not revealed to a casual enquirer, but only to authorised users, according to the business rules.
# The development process
the process was:
1- meeting the team and defining skills and strengths.
2- assigning initial tasks.
3- work on UML diagrams.
4- create the database using mySQL.
5- create a file structure that follows a 3-tier layered architecture (presentation-processing-storage) for this system.
6- write basic classes and objects in java according to UML diagrams.
7- write processing layer that creates connections to DB (pushing/pulling data)
8- write presentation layer using java swing
9- document and write report
*note: some of the steps are strongly dependent on each other and have been done simultaneously 
# The final result
The project was done partially. only the following functionalities were made:
1-Registration and authentication for guest/host
2-adding properties for host
3-viewing properties for enquirers and guests
4-viewing own properties for hosts
# What I have learned
I have learned couple of valuable lessons:
1- Being able to communicate and work with different teammates of unique personalities can be more crucial than being able to write lines of code.
2- a team must have a clear plan or strategy before starting to work or code anything
3- constant communication and share of thoughts is a must for a successful software life cycle.
4- Whenever a teammate is not able to do their work, an opportunity presents itself for me to learn a new thing that is not extra work, but more knowledge in my bank. 
Moreover, I have strengthened my knowledge of Java and the foundations I've studied in the first year. Now I feel more confident using object oriented programming languages and it is much easier for me to think abstractly.
